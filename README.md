## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# POS Enhancements

This project includes additional backend modules for a POS system:

- Finance: Incomes and Expenses with categories
- Inventory: Raw Materials + Stock Movements (moving-average valuation)
- Product Recipes: HPP (COGS) calculation and batch production (consumes materials)
- Employees: Basic employee management (name, email, phone, pin) and roles (owner/manager/staff)
- Attendance: Employee clock-in/out (optional geotag + photo), self history, and admin reports (JSON/CSV)
- API for Flutter (PIN login/token, clock-in/out, history, profile)

## New Migrations

- incomes (updated to: date, reference_no, amount, category_id, notes, created_by, updated_by, timestamps, softDeletes)
- income_categories, expense_categories
- expenses (date, reference_no, amount, category_id, vendor, notes, created_by, updated_by, timestamps, softDeletes)
- raw_materials, raw_material_movements
- products (add: sku, sell_price, cogs_method, active)
- product_recipes, product_recipe_items
- employees, attendances

## New Env

Add to your .env:

- OFFICE_LAT= -6.200000
- OFFICE_LNG= 106.816666
- OFFICE_RADIUS_M= 100
- ATTENDANCE_PHOTO_REQUIRED=false

## API Auth

- Admin/backoffice uses Sanctum (already enabled). Roles used: users.roles where 'admin' is treated as owner/manager.
- Attendance API uses a separate guard 'employee' (Sanctum token for Employee model).

## Endpoints (highlights)

- POST /api/auth/pin-login
- Incomes: GET/POST/GET:id/PUT/DELETE /api/incomes
- Expenses: GET/POST/GET:id/PUT/DELETE /api/expenses
- Categories: /api/income-categories, /api/expense-categories
- Raw Materials: /api/raw-materials, /api/raw-materials/{id}/adjust-stock, /api/raw-materials/{id}/movements
- Recipes & HPP: /api/products/{id}/recipe (GET/POST), /api/products/{id}/produce (POST), /api/products/{id}/cogs (GET)
- Employees: /api/employees (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH activate/deactivate)
- Attendance (Flutter):
  - GET /api/employees/me
  - GET /api/attendances/me?date_from&date_to
  - POST /api/attendances/clock-in { lat?, lng?, photo_base64? }
  - POST /api/attendances/clock-out { lat?, lng?, photo_base64? }
  - GET /api/reports/attendances?date_from&date_to&employee_id?&format=json|csv

Rate limiting is applied on attendance endpoints.

## How to use (Flutter via Dio)

Example PIN login:

```
json path=null start=null
POST /api/auth/pin-login
{
  "phone_or_email": "staff@example.com",
  "pin": "1234"
}
```

Use returned token as Bearer for subsequent attendance requests.

## Swagger UI

Open http://your-app.test/api/docs (non-production) or (production: restricted to admin). The UI reads public/openapi.yaml.

## Storage

Attendance photos are stored under storage/app/public/attendances and served via /storage after linking:

```
bash path=null start=null
php artisan storage:link
```

## Tests

Run tests:

```
bash path=null start=null
php artisan test
```

Includes feature tests for PIN login, attendance flow, and recipe/inventory (moving average + HPP).

## Notes

- COGS is calculated using moving average of raw materials with waste percentage: HPP = Î£( qty_per_yield * (1 + waste_pct/100) * average_unit_cost ) / yield_qty.
- Hooks into order consumption are optional; current implementation exposes a ProductionCompleted event. To consume on sales, dispatch an event after order is paid and subscribe a listener that calls RecipeService->produce based on quantities.
